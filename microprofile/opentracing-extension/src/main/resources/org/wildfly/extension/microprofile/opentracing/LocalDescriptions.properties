microprofile-opentracing-smallrye.tracer.sender-auth-token=The Auth Token to be added as "Bearer" on Authorization headers for requests sent to the endpoint.
microprofile-opentracing-smallrye.tracer.sender-auth-user=The Basic Auth username to be added on Authorization headers for requests sent to the endpoint.
microprofile-opentracing-smallrye.tracer.sender-auth-password=The Basic Auth password to be added on Authorization headers for requests sent to the endpoint.
microprofile-opentracing-smallrye.tracer.reporter-log-spans=Whether the reporter should log the spans.
microprofile-opentracing-smallrye.tracer.reporter-flush-interval=The flush interval when reporting spans remotely.
microprofile-opentracing-smallrye.tracer.reporter-max-queue-size=The maximum queue size for use when reporting spans remotely.
microprofile-opentracing-smallrye.tracer.tracer_id_128bit=Opt-in to use 128 bit traceIds. By default, uses 64 bits.
microprofile-opentracing-smallrye.tracer.tags=The tracer level tags.
microprofile-opentracing-smallrye.tracer.add=Add the configuration of the jaeger tracer.
microprofile-opentracing-smallrye.tracer.remove=Remove the configuration of the jaeger tracer.
